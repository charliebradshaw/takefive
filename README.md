# Take Five

# General Information
My code prototype is a musical rendition of Dave Brubeck's jazz classic "Take Five". The prototype was produced with the goal of seeing how traditional music can be blended to suit a modern, digital world. It's purpose is to understand the lengths in which we can utilise code to our creative advantages and exlpore unqiue and modern ways of producing music.

# Technologies Used
This prototype was coded in Python using the software TunePad.

# Features
The code has features such as the use of different instruments, timings, pacings and volumes all used to replicate the song in a digital way.
